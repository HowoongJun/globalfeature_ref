## NetVLAD

* [NetVLAD: CNN architecture for weakly supervised place recognition, CVPR 2016](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Arandjelovic_NetVLAD_CNN_Architecture_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

This reference code is based on the code of [uzh-rpg](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/netvlad_tf_open), which was [originally implemented in Matlab](https://github.com/Relja/netvlad).
Tensorflow checkpoint is based on the [uzh-rpg](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/netvlad_tf_open), so you have to download it through the github repository. 

We modified the work for our own global localization framework.
